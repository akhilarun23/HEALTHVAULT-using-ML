This is an AI health consulting application which uses an ID called patient ID to access the data of of the patients including their entire history of consultation with the AI software, the diseases diagnosed and the medicines prescribed. The AI will give the most probable disease based on the symptoms that you enter and also the medication and the diet plan to follow for a particular disease. The program currently uses local database to store the information of the patients but in the future we will develop the software so that the information can be stored in a cloud and it can be accessed by multiple hospitals anywhere in the world. This will solve the problem of getting new accounts in every new hospital and building your history there and if we change the hospital it is really tiring job to transfer all your medical history to a new hospital. By keeping such a database where all you diseases and medications in a database in a cloud we will not have to go through all that hassle and we can be treated anywhere in the world without having to go through the same procedure to build a history in each hospital.
